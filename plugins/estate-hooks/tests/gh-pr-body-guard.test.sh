# Test suite for the fail-closed PR-body/title guard:
#   .claude/hooks/gh-pr-body-guard.sh   (PreToolUse guard for `gh pr create`)
#
# Self-contained: builds throwaway git repos with a SYNTHETIC .gitleaks.toml
# whose checkout-relative [extend] token the hook resolves to a SYNTHETIC
# operator ruleset installed at the suite's own fixed path (a private
# XDG_CONFIG_HOME — NEVER the machine's real install, NEVER the real private
# ruleset, and NEVER a real PII pattern in this public repo). There is no
# checkout-relative fallback; the checkout-relative rules file appears only to
# prove it is NEVER consulted (see "never falls back" below).
# Drives the hook by feeding it PreToolUse JSON on stdin — it never runs `gh`
# for real. Runs identically locally and in CI (CI installs gitleaks; see
# .github/workflows/test.yml).
#
# Canaries are randomly generated AKIA + 16 chars of [A-Z2-7] — NEVER ending in
# EXAMPLE (gitleaks' aws-access-token rule allowlists '.+EXAMPLE$', which would
# yield a false "clean"). No operator PII appears anywhere in this suite.
