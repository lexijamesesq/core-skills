#!/usr/bin/env bash
# gh-pr-body-guard.sh — FAIL-CLOSED PreToolUse guard that scans a `gh pr create`
# (or `gh pr edit`) invocation for guarded literals BEFORE it runs. A PR title
# and body are public the instant `gh pr create` executes; gitleaks' git/commit
# hooks scan file diffs and NEVER see `gh` arguments, so without this guard the
# title/body are an unscanned public surface.
#
# WHY SCAN THE WHOLE COMMAND STRING (deliberate over-block):
#   Parsing gh's flags (--body / --body-file / --title / --fill / heredocs /
#   $(cat <<'EOF' ...)) is fragile and is defeated by the first unusual quoting.
#   Instead we write the ENTIRE tool_input.command to a temp file and run
#   `gitleaks dir` on it. The title and body are literally present in that text,
#   so any guarded literal is caught regardless of how it was passed.
#   CONSEQUENCE — this over-blocks on purpose: a guarded value ANYWHERE in the
#   command (a `-R owner/repo`, a random flag, a comment) blocks the create, not
#   only one in the body. That is the safe direction; it is stated in the block
#   message so a human is never mystified.
#   PR TITLES ARE IN SCOPE: titles are frequently synced from Linear issue titles
#   which routinely carry employer + internal product names (a guarded class).
#   Ticket refs (`Closes <TEAM>-N`) are ALLOWED and are not a guarded class — the
#   operator ruleset carries no ticket-id rule, so they do not match.
#
# --body-file / -F: those contents are NOT in the command string, so we also read
#   and scan the referenced file. To find the path we tokenize the command with a
#   shell-aware parser (python3 `shlex.split`), NOT whitespace splitting. That
#   matters: a `-F` mentioned inside a quoted body ("... use -F ...") stays inside
#   the body token and is never a standalone argv element, so it is not mistaken
#   for the flag. BOTH forms are FAIL-CLOSED: if `--body-file`/`-F` is present but
#   its path does not resolve to a readable file — or the flag has no argument, or
#   the command cannot be tokenized — we BLOCK (the intended PR body cannot be
#   scanned). python3 is a hard dependency; missing python3 -> BLOCK.
#
# FAIL-CLOSED contract (North star: a missing binary, an unresolvable config, or
# an indeterminate target must BLOCK, never silently pass):
#   * jq / python3 missing   -> BLOCK (cannot parse the invocation / its args).
#   * gitleaks missing       -> BLOCK (via gl_preflight; names the install).
#   * no ruleset located (payload-cwd / cd-prefix / own-repo / env var) -> BLOCK.
#   * located .gitleaks.toml broken ([extend] unresolvable) -> BLOCK (gl_preflight).
#   * GITLEAKS_OPERATOR_RULES set but unreadable -> BLOCK.
#   * --body-file / -F unresolvable, no arg, or unparsable command -> BLOCK.
#   * gitleaks FTL / nonzero -> BLOCK.
# A guarded literal is NEVER printed — only rule id + location (gl_summarize_report).
#
# RULESET LOCATION (works from any session with ZERO configuration):
# Claude Code's PreToolUse payload reports the SESSION cwd, not the directory a
# command cd's into — and a cd inside a Bash command does not persist. So even
# `cd ~/bin/dotty && gh pr create ...` arrives here with cwd = the session root
# (often the vault: a git repo with NO .gitleaks.toml). What the guard needs is
# the operator RULESET, not any particular checkout — so it locates one four ways
# (see "LOCATE THE OPERATOR RULESET" below), first hit wins:
#   1. the payload cwd's repo          2. a `cd <path> && ...` prefix's repo
#   3. the guard's OWN repo (this file ships in the tooling repo, which carries
#      the .gitleaks.toml [extend]ing the provisioned operator-ruleset symlink)
#   4. $GITLEAKS_OPERATOR_RULES        else -> BLOCK
# Paths 1-3 need NO configuration on a provisioned machine; path 4 is an override
# for an UNPROVISIONED machine and is never required. (An env var would have to be
# hand-set in two places — profile + shell — which is the drift this epic kills.)
# Paths 1-3 locate a repo CONFIG; the operator ruleset it extends is resolved by
# gl_preflight — see git-hooks/gitleaks-common.sh for the resolution contract.
# Fail-closed is UNCHANGED: once a ruleset is located, a missing binary, a broken
# config, or any finding still BLOCKS.
#
# SCOPE POROSITY (disclosed, not a defect): this guard recognises a PR-publishing
# command by STRING-MATCHING the normalised command text (see SELF-SCOPE below).
# String matching cannot see through shell indirection: a command that assembles
# the subcommand via a variable (`c=create; gh pr $c --body ...`), a shell alias
# or function, or `eval`, will NOT match the scope regex and passes UNSCANNED.
# This is a known, accepted gap — the same class git-hook-bypass-guard.sh
# discloses. The threat model is an ACCIDENTAL leak in an ordinary `gh pr create`,
# NOT a determined operator routing around their own guard. Do not read the scope
# match as a security boundary; it is a best-effort trigger for the common case.
#
# Blocks a PreToolUse tool call by exiting 2 with the reason on stderr.

# SELF-SCOPE. This guard concerns `gh pr create` / `gh pr edit` and nothing
# else, and it must decide that itself — the settings `"if"` field cannot be
# trusted to do it.
#
# `"if"` IS a supported, documented field, and it works. But it FAILS OPEN into
# running the hook: when the pattern names more than the bare command (as
# `"Bash(gh pr create *)"` does), Claude Code runs the hook anyway for any
# command containing `$(...)`, backticks, or `$VAR`, because it cannot statically
# evaluate what those expand to. So `"if"` is a performance pre-filter, never a
# correctness boundary. A non-blocking reminder hook may rely on it. A guard that
# BLOCKS may not: registered on `"if"` alone, this fail-closed hook fired on an
# ordinary shell command and blocked every Bash call issued from a cwd without a
# .gitleaks.toml. Verified the hard way. Scope here, in the script, or not at all.
#
# Match `gh pr create|edit` as a COMMAND, not as a bare substring. Two failures
# this avoids, both found by testing rather than by reading:
#
#   fail-OPEN: a shell line-continuation splitting the subcommand
#     `gh pr \`<newline>`create`
#   survives whitespace normalisation as `gh pr \ create`, so a substring test
#   misses it and the guard silently skips a real PR create. Continuations are
#   therefore stripped BEFORE matching.
#
#   fail-CLOSED over-block: a substring test fires on any command that merely
#   MENTIONS the literal — an echo, a grep, a doc edit, a test loop. Since this
#   guard blocks when cwd has no .gitleaks.toml, that makes those commands
#   unrunnable from a vault-rooted session. So `gh` must appear in command
#   position: at the start, or after a shell separator, optionally preceded by
#   env assignments (`FOO=bar gh pr create ...`).
#
# Real newlines become `;` rather than spaces — they ARE command separators, and
# collapsing them to whitespace would hide `gh pr create` on a later line of a
# multi-line script behind a leading space, reopening the fail-open.
