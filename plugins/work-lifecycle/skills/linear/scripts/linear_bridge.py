linear_bridge.py — GraphQL bridge transport + Linear primitives for the traffic-cone
lifecycle scripts (cone_preflight.py is the other half; see that module's docstring).

Everything that talks to Linear's GraphQL API through the operator's authenticated
bridge command lives here, in one place. The bridge command itself is never named or
embedded in this file — it comes from `--bridge-cmd` or the `LINEAR_GQL_CMD`
environment variable (see `linear.gql_bridge_cmd` in the consumer's private
CLAUDE.md > Configuration). This script never touches op paths, tokens, or vault
refs; neither may appear in any file in this repo (public).

Subcommands:

                                              duplicate entry link, retries
                                              on a detected race (default 3
                                              attempts)

Identifier resolution: every subcommand taking an issue reference accepts both
`TEAM-N` identifiers and UUIDs. `issue(id:)` is tried as given first; if Linear's
GraphQL rejects it, the script falls back to an `issues` filter on team key +
number. Callers never pre-resolve.

Read-back law: every mutation subcommand (claim-write, release-delegate,
set-state, decisions-append) performs its own independent re-fetch after the
mutation and reports `verified: true|false` plus the observed values. No
mutation result is ever reported trusted on its own say-so.

Exit codes:
    0  success
    1  script bug (internal error, malformed API response the script cannot
       safely proceed on)
    2  bridge command missing/not executable, or a usage/config gap — the
       message names which env var or flag to set
    3  bridge auth failure (401/403-shaped bridge stderr/response)
    4  GraphQL-level error returned by the API (the error payload is echoed),
       or an ambiguous `operator` resolution (candidates are echoed)
    5  transient/network failure, reported only after 2 retries (1s, 3s
       backoff) — this includes Linear's "App user not valid" scope glitch,
       which is transient per existing `/linear` law, now enforced in code
    6  create-comment's body failed the in-process lint-body check (bare
       @mentions) — refused before any network call was made
    7  decisions-append's entry link is already present in the Decisions
       document — refused before any mutation was attempted
    8  decisions-append's read-back mismatched on every retry — a race it
       could not catch up with, reported rather than silently accepted

All output is one JSON object to stdout per invocation. `lint-body` is the one
subcommand with its own local exit-code meaning (0 clean, 1 violations found,
2 usage) since it does no network I/O — see its docstring below.

    own read-back can complete and report verified before a second writer's
    write lands, so the second write clobbers the first with no further
    check on either side — narrower (sub-second, both writers' full
